## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT INSTALL, THIS INTEGRATION DOES NOT WORK YET. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HARM CAUSED BY INSTALLING THIS INTEGRATION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**This integration is still a work in progress.**

Furthermore, this integration is not endorsed by Brunata, and could stop functioning at any time at their behest; your Brunata account might also be closed, although no EULA is provided for the Brunata Online Portal at the time of writing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Please ensure your credentials work on [online.brunata.com][brunata] ‚ö†Ô∏è

If your credentials don't work **AND** you use a different Brunata portal to view your metrics, please open a pull request and/or contact me on the [Home Assistant Forum][ha_profile].

In most cases, you will likely have to add support for alternate portals yourself; I will gladly assist you in getting the login-flow working and finding the API endpoints. Then you can simply submit a Pull Request, and I'll review it when I have time üôÇ
